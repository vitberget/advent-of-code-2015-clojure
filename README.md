# Advent of Code 2015

Held a live coding/tutorial kind of thing for my colleagues.

Recording available in the Teams chat of that meeting.

Day 1 and day 2 completely solved.

~~Encountered some problems with day 3 and time ran out, 
so homework for all participants to fix it. ;)~~

Fixed day 3, was a matter of reading the instructions properly.

Instructions: houses where presents delivered at least once (presents in house > 0)  
While demoing: houses where presents delivered more than once (presents in house > 1)
